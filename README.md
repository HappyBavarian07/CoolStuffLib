# CoolStuffLib
The Library with my changed Version of the Command Manager and Menu System from Kody Simpson.
-----
Also it contains my Language Manager, which is a really powerful tool, that allows developers to manage multiple languages very easily with minimal effort.

# Future Updates
In the future there will also be a few other Systems like a MySQL client or File Manager.
A Language Translator to translate a Default Language File like English into other Languages using either a custom api key or google translate.
